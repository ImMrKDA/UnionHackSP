#UNION HACK - SUMMATIVE PRESENTATION

This project was about symbols and brands. To develop more our creativity on this specific sectors we were told to mash up four different flags or do four different variations of the same flag. I decided to do four variations of four different flags.

###BRAZILIAN FLAG MASH UP

The first flag I decided to play with was the flag of Brazil. To be honest, this was the first time I ever played with a country flag in photoshop. I've done other things but never mash up a flag, so this was a challenge for me.

I wanted to mash up the flag but without the intention of making it an absolutely new flag. I wanted to keep the colours and the symbols but obviosuly I had to change something, so I decided to change the position of the colours and the place of the shapes or symbols. I'm going to start talking about the changes I did with the symbols. The blue circle with the white stars and the sentence "ORDEM E PROGRESSO" which means "ORDER AND PROGRESS" changed position with the yellow diamond. So the diamond gets the colours of the circle from the original flag. Now, the circle has the diamond in it unlike the original flag where the diamond twisted had the blue circle in it. The way I changed the colour background and the circle colour was basically giving to the circle the colour background from the original flag, so the background colour of my mashed up flag is yellow and the circle is green.
