#UNION HACK - SUMMATIVE PRESENTATION

This project was about symbols and brands. To develop more our creativity on this specific sectors we were told to mash up four different flags or do four different variations of the same flag. I decided to do four variations of four different flags.

###BRAZILIAN FLAG

The first flag I decided to play with was the flag of Brazil. To be honest, this was the first time I ever played with a country flag in photoshop. I've done other things but never mash up a flag, so this was a challenge for me.

I wanted to mash up the flag but without the intention of making it an absolutely new flag. I wanted to keep the colours and the symbols but obviosuly I had to change something, so I decided to change the position of the colours and the place of the shapes or symbols. I'm going to start talking about the changes I did with the symbols. The blue circle with the white stars and the sentence "ORDEM E PROGRESSO" which means "ORDER AND PROGRESS" changed position with the yellow diamond. So the diamond gets the colours of the circle from the original flag. Now, the circle has the diamond in it unlike the original flag where the diamond twisted had the blue circle in it. The way I changed the colour background and the circle colour was basically giving to the circle the colour background from the original flag, so the background colour of my mashed up flag is yellow and the circle is green.

This was the first experiment of this project, I kind of like this flag but I know I could do better, I probably didn't choose the best flag to mash up but anyways I kept working on this projects and I came up with more flags.

###CANADIAN FLAG

The second flag I chose was the flag of Canada. I live in this country for five months so one of the first flags that came to my mind and that I thought I could mash up was the Canadian flag.

With the canadian flag I was trying to five a strong message more than designing and new flag for the country. This idea came from the fact that a couple of years ago before I went to Canada I read an article about teenagers from Canada being in the second place of the top teenagers of the world that consume marihuana. So I decided to give a message that shows the fact of marihuana being illegal something that shouldn't be good to do. When I presented this image to the class I came up with another idea from the feedback that my teachers and classmates gave me. Instead of making a _black X_ I could leave it without anything that covers the weed symbol or make it look like a jail. Here's the result:

I like more this flag that the first one with the _black X_ covering the weed symbol. I think this one makes it look more like something forbidden or something that you shouldn't do.
